So far I want to really thank:
	Marcin Drzewiecki for his child-like and unstoppable enthusiasm for finding bugs every single time I pull out my phone;
	Maciej Spycha≈Ça for his always apt remarks, the idea of animating dice, and help when my the project stopped understanding me;
	my sister, Karolina, and her friend Lidia for spreading the game & pointing out the lengthiness name.
