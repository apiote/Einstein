    <string name="htpHeader2">2. Turns</string>
    <string name="htpPara2">Each turn starts with rolling a die. Then player must move their matching stone. If it’s no longer on the board, the player must move remaining stone whose number is next-highest or next-lowest to the one shown by the die.\nPlayer may move their stone only one cell to their up, left or diagonal up-left (picture 2).\nIf a stone lies already on the target cell, it’s removed from the board (picture 3).\nIf there’s only one of player’s stones remaining on the board, there’s no need to roll the die—the stone is automatically selected.</string>
